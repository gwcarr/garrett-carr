```{r setup}
library(ipumsr)
library(R.utils)
library(tidyverse)
```

# Extracting file

```{r}
gunzip("nhis_00002.dat.gz")
```

NOTE: To load data, you must download both the extract's data and the DDI
and also set the working directory to the folder with these files (or change the path below).

```{r}
if (!require("ipumsr")) stop("Reading IPUMS data into R requires the ipumsr package. It can be installed using the following command: install.packages('ipumsr')")

ddi <- read_ipums_ddi("nhis_00002.xml", lower_vars = TRUE)
data <- read_ipums_micro(ddi)

```
The Data is included only from the year 2010 on. I may go back and change this if I find we need more data.
```{r}
personal <- data %>% 
  select(year, age, sex, racea, occ, usualft, incfam07on, gotwage, height, weight) %>% 
  na_if(0) %>% 
  drop_na(height, weight) %>% 
  summarize(
    ages = count(age),
    genders = count(sex),
    races = count(racea),
  )
```
