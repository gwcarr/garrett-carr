Data
================

## Description

While all data live here, only data that are small and can be shared
publically will be pushed.

As some of the models computed are long running, especially on my
computer, I’ve set the models to cache here in the cache folder. They
shouldn’t be pushed to Github, but saved on your local machine in the
Data folder.
