## Question 1

Revisit the Reed frog survival data, data(reedfrogs), and add the predation
and size treatment variables to the varying intercepts model. Consider models with
either predictor alone, both predictors, as well as a model including their interaction.
What do you infer about the causal influence of these predictor variables? Also focus
on the inferred variation across tanks (the Ïƒ across tanks). Explain why it changes
as it does across models with different predictors included.

```{r setup}
library(tidyverse)
library(rethinking)
library(cmdstanr)
```

```{r Frog-Data}
data("reedfrogs")

frogs <- as_tibble(reedfrogs)



```
