So, we look at the data from the !Kung census, by loading the proper data:

```{r setup}
library(rethinking)
library(tidyverse)
data(Howell1)
data <- as_tibble(Howell1)
```

Then we create the prior, filtering heights for ages 18 and over only.

```{r}
# filter out younger than 18

data <- d %>% 
  filter(age >= 18)

# mu ∼ Normal(178, 20)
# sigma ∼ Uniform(0, 50) 
# height_i ∼ Normal(mu, sigma)


# Data Simulation:
prior <- tibble(
  mu = rnorm(n = 1000, mean = 178, sd = 20),
  sigma = runif(n = 1000, min = 0, max = 50)
) %>% 
  # Here, we simulate the data distribution, based on what we decided our prior values to be
  mutate(height = rnorm(n = 1000, mean = mu, sd = sigma))
# We take a look at our prior predictive distribution
dens(prior$height)
```
