## Repository Organization

Each repository will have a similar organization. There are
certain limitations on the size and type of files that can be pushed to
GitHub. There are also certain things that shouldn’t be accessible by
the public (e.g., data we have a license to access). For these reasons,
we have folders and files that are pushed to GitHub and those that are
not.

### Pushed to GitHub

  - `/Assignments` Each assignment will be included as an R Markdown
    file (e.g., `Assignment-02.Rmd`) knit as a `github_document` to
    produce a Markdown file (e.g., `Assignment-02.md`).
  - `/Notes` Notes as I work through *Statistical
    Rethinking* will be found here. It will be an organized series
    of R Markdown files (e.g., `01_The-Golem-of-Prague.Rmd`).
  - `/Project` Everything related to the project will be found here (see the
    [project organization
    details](https://github.com/quant-seminar/repo-template/tree/main/Project)).
  - `README` This page, which will include any other organization details to make it
    easy to navigate this repository.

### Not Pushed to GitHub

  - `/Private` PDFs to keep track of reading locally and
    other files to keep private in the repository.
