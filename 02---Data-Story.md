02 Data Story
================

## Initial Model

The variables available to me are:

-   ID
-   Age
-   Experience
-   Income
-   ZIP Code
-   Family
-   CCAvg
-   Education
-   Mortgage
-   Personal Loan
-   Securities Account
-   CD Account
-   Online
-   CreditCard

ID is just a simple row index, so that will obviously be excluded.

### Creating The Model

I will initially set the priors as flat. We will start with a small
number of predictors.

``` r
loan ~ binomial(1, p) # Binomial distribution of likelihood to accept the personal loan
logit(p) = beta_age  + beta_income + beta_ccavg  # logit model for acceptance of loan likelihood
beta_age ~ normal(0, 0.01 )          # Effect of Age on loan acceptance 
beta_income ~ normal(0, 0.01)        # Effect of income
beta_ccavg ~ normal(0, 0.01)         # Effect of average credit card balance
```

### Running the Model

Just using the intial model, to see what the output looks like

``` r
# Create data list
loan_list <- list(
  loan = data$`Personal Loan`,
  age = data$Age,
  income = data$Income,
  ccavg = data$CCAvg
)

# Fitting the Initial Model
fit01 <- ulam(
  alist(
    loan ~ dbinom(1, p),
    logit(p) <- beta_age * age + beta_inc * income + beta_cc * ccavg,
    beta_age ~ dnorm(0, 0.5),
    beta_inc ~ dnorm(0, 1),
    beta_cc ~ dnorm(0, 1.5)
  ),
  data = loan_list,
  log_lik = TRUE,
  chains = 4,
  cores = 4,
  cmdstan = TRUE
)
```

    ## 
    ## Warning: 963 of 2000 (48.0%) transitions ended with a divergence.
    ## This may indicate insufficient exploration of the posterior distribution.
    ## Possible remedies include: 
    ##   * Increasing adapt_delta closer to 1 (default is 0.8) 
    ##   * Reparameterizing the model (e.g. using a non-centered parameterization)
    ##   * Using informative or weakly informative prior distributions

Stan didnâ€™t like that very much, probably because the priors are trash,
and not very informative.
